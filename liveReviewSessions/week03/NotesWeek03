Q1: does the folder name (e.g.






OPERATORS:
    *Arithmetic Operators
        -, +, /, * and modulus % (gives us the remainder)
    * Unary Operators:
        + positive, - negative
        ++ increase value by 1 (we will use there certain loops)
        -- decrease value by 1
        ! not operator

    *Assignment Operators
        different between "=" (assigns a value) and "==" (checks if the statements are equal)

        "+=" : a += 20; ----> a = a + 20; Shorthand Operators

    * Relational Operators : When we use relational operators we use boolean
        > greater than sign
        < less than sign
        >= greater equal
        <= less than equal
        == equal
        != not equal

    * Logical Operators
        & And Operator, && Bitwise AND Operator
        | Or Operator, || Bitwise OR Operator

    * Control Flow Statements - Conditional Statements
        if (condition) {do this} else { go here if it is false}
        if (condition 1) - else if ( condition 2) else {}
